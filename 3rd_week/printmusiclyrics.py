# For those of you that would like an exercise to work on —> Many songs follow a familiar variation of the pattern of 
# verse refrain verse refrain…..The verse tells the story and it isn’t repeated, but the refrain part of the song is 
# repeated throughout the song…..CHALLENGE:: find lyrics to a song you MOST LOVE and that follows the pattern. Write a 
# program that prints out the lyrics to this song you choose using as “few lines of python code”

# Second exercise——> write function that takes in a first name and a last_name and prints out a nicely formatted 
# full_name in a full sentence. Your sentence could be as simple as “hey how are you doing today , {name}” You will 
# call your function three times with a different name each time
